I am a physicist in University of Oxford working as a postdoctoral research
assistant and senior demonstrator in the Physics Computing lab.
This blog is about anything that interests me.

My research is about high energy density physics and medical physics.
In high energy density, we are trying to understand the properties of materials
with high density (about solid density) and very high temperature
(about a million degrees of celsius or more) with simulations and experiments.
From the medical physics side, we are working to make the real-time treatment
planning for radiotherapy happens.
Although working as a physicist, I love to read articles about statistics and
computational algorithms, such as machine learning, compressed sensing,
optimization, MCMC, etc. I have also used those techniques to get some new
and interesting results in physics.
