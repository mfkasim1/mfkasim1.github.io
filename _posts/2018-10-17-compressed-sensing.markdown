When you take an image of a scenery, how much information do you need to store
to be able to show the image without significant distortion? The answer can be
quite small. This is because, for example, if on an image there is a pixel
that represents blue sky, then there will be higher chance of the pixels next
to it have the blue color. That makes it unnecessary to save all pixels
information to show the image.
